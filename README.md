# _Maintenance Calculator_ (aka The Lunk-inator)


## Project Overview

### Project Name

Maintenance Calculator 

### Project Description
--- 
This project is a maintenance calculator which calculates the caloric intake needed to maintain an individual's current body weight indefinitely. The reasons for this project are Meal preps are not possible without knowing how the body react to a certain level of caloric intake. This tool uses the user's weight and caloric intake for a certain number of days to calculate their maintainance intake which can be used for the user to begin meal prep or reference.

## API and Data Sample
Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This must be properly formatted. An example is below:

```[
     {
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "reczpTLdRCcDlllEB",
            "fields": {
                "days": 1,
                "weight(lbs)": 201,
                "kcal/d": 2000
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T13:59:49.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recvY0mhObdGVIihb",
            "fields": {
                "days": 2,
                "weight(lbs)": 200,
                "kcal/d": 2000
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T13:59:49.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recocoa9prF1BeBTe",
            "fields": {
                "days": 3,
                "weight(lbs)": 200,
                "kcal/d": 2000
            },
            "createdTime": "2021-07-13T14:30:00.000Z"
        }
    ],
    "offset": "recocoa9prF1BeBTe"
}
}
```
## MVP/PostMVP
--- 

### MVP
These are examples only. Replace with your own MVP features.

#### Planning & React
---

*  Completely write out the README.md

* Use CRA to make React App 

* NPM Install react-router-dom and axios

* Create 6 different components in react app

* Make an organize react folder that programmer can understand

* Use Axios to GET & POST data from/to airtable
 
* Use only react to chnage DOM (No HTML nor JS append methods)

* Remember have a minimum of 20 commits total (Save your game often)

#### Styling 
--- 

* Use some sort of styling (CSS, Styled Components, CSS-in-JS, or Component Library *tailwind?*)

* Use flexbox or CSS grid to style page (unless component library does this)

* Add responsive design for 2 screen sizes via media query (desktop and mobile - unless component library handles this too)

#### Linting 
---

* Indent properly 

* Use semantic variable names when appropriate

* use camelCase, kebab-case adn PascalCase when necessary

* remove unneeded boilerplate react and code

* remove all console.log() and commented out code (functional notes and comments are ok to stay)

#### Post-MVP

*  Adv. CSS Styling (Be sure to leave sources just in case)
 
* NPMJS Shopping and Implementation (Because why not...)
 
* Experimental API implementation (from P1 and 1 more...)
